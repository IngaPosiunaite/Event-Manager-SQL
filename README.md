<h4> Event Management System

<h5> A simple event management system was designed and built. Delegates have individual records in the system. Each delegate can provide details of their personal information (name, their date of birth, email address, and contact telephone number).

<h5> Events have a title, description, start date and time, and end date and time. Also, an event has a quota: the maximum number of bookings that can be made for the event.

<h5> A delegate can cancel a booking and choose to re–book onto that same event. There is no limit to the number of times a delegate can re–book onto an event, but they can only have one live booking for any individual event.
